# Shell Scripts
### Purpose
Folder to organize various shell scripts to keep the root project directory clean.

### Usage
Most scripts run under the assumption that they are being called from the root project directory (e.g., ~/GitHub/Aerocube). Therefore, scripts **must** be called as such:
```
ubuntu@tegra-ubuntu:~/GitHub/Aerocube$ shellScripts/myScript.sh
```
